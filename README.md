# skill-verifcation-check
This  idea is to build a skill verification system. 
On  CV and application, people make  claims  about  how skillfull they are. which sometimes may be true or not. 
This skill verification system would validate skills in a simple and objective way. 
Examples of skills would be judged anonymously by trusted institutions,employers etc. . 
These users  will verify and validate the endorsments or certificatons that approve the authencity of the skills stated in credebtials.

For example, if someone is an expert in react.js, they put up a claim and attach proof such as their Github repos then other members in the same domain would verify it. 
And based on the consensus, the claim is either ‘endorsed’ or ‘flagged’.

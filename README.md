# to-do-list
This Project is a decentralized to-do list application (dApp) built on Ethereum blockchain using solidity smart contracts for backend logic and React for frontend interface. It allows users to create, mark as complete Edit and delete tasks.

Decentralized: All data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring trust.
User-Friendly Interface: The frontend will be  built using React, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Task Management: Users can create, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
Smart Contracts: Solidity smart contracts handle the backend logic, ensuring secure and tamper-resistant operations.
MetaMask Integration: Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to interact with the dApp.
Real-Time Updates: Tasks are updated in real-time as transactions are confirmed on the blockchain.

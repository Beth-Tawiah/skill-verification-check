# skill-verifcation-check
This next project idea is to build a skill verification system. 
On  platforms, people make  claims  about  how skillfull they are. which sometimes may be true or not. 
This skill verification system would validate skills in a simple and objective way. 
Examples of skills would be judged anonymously by random  users. 
Users will verify and validate the claim and get rewarded for their work. 

For example, if someone is an expert in react.js, they put up a claim and attach proof such as their Github repos then other members in the same domain would verify it. 
And based on the consensus, the claim is either ‘endorsed’ or ‘flagged’.
